> The [CompTIA Security+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security) exam is an excellent entry point for a career in information security. The latest version, SY0-501, expands coverage of cloud security, virtualization, and mobile security. This course prepares exam candidates for the critical Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities domain of the exam. By learning about malware, networking and application security exploitations, and social engineering, you'll be prepared to answer questions from the examâ€”and strengthen your own organization's systems and defenses. Author Mike Chapple, an IT leader with over 15 years of experience, also covers the processes for discovering and mitigating threats and attacks, and conducting penetration testing and scanning for vulnerabilities.
