## Introduction

### Introduction

- Overview
- Different type of hacks
- Fundamental Security Principle
- Techniques behind the most common attacks on your server

## 1. Security Overview

### What is security?
- Definition: Keep a web server and its applications protected or safe from harm
- Awareness + Protection = Security
- General principle to follow
- Most common attacks
- Useful strategies

### Why security matters
- The low threshold of entry may leave the impression that web development is easy
- 

### What is a hacker?

### Total security is unachievable

> The only secure computer is one that's unplugged, locked in a safe, and buried 20 feet under the ground in a secret location... and I'm not even too sure about that one.
> —Dennis Hughes, FBI
From: <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/UNIX_Computing_Security/Introduction>

- There are always ways to gain access that we don't expect.
- Newly discovered vulnerabilities are called zero-day exploits.
- zero-day exploits: known only to hackers, kept secret and traded
- How much security?
    - Should match your needs and goals
    - Execute the security you need really well
    - Re-evaluate periodically

### Get in the security mind-set

- Everyone, all the time
- Weakest link in your security is your level of security
- Average users have to be mindful of security
- Decision makers have to be mindful of security
- Security may require time and money
- Allocate for security in project timelines

Regular security reviews
- Review all technology in use
- Review code in use and still in development
- Review procedures
- Review access privileges
- Educate and re-educate


Better developers
- Fully learn technologies
- Better programmers write more secure programs
- Write software tests for common security concerns

### Write a security policy

Security policy
- Communicates how information assets are protected
- Rules or guidelines
- Keep it simple, clear, and easy to follow
- Involve all stakeholders
- Review periodically - security concerns change

## 2. General Security Principles

### Least privilege

- > We assume that because they're friendly, they wouldn't do us harm
- > "Every program and every privileged user of the system should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job. - Jerome Saltzer, Communications of the ACM"
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege>
- Code should be limited in what it exposes and what it accesses.

```php
class User {
    public $valid_users = array('tom', 'mary', 'steve');
    public $password = 'secretpassword'

    public function authenticate($user, $pwd) {
        return in_array($user, $valid_users) && password_matches($pwd);
    }

    public function password_matches($pwd) {
        return $password == $pwd;
    }
}
```

Least Privilege Benefits
- Code stability
    - Controlled data access
    - Easier to test actions and interactions
- System security
    - Vulnerabilities are limited and localized

### Simple is more secure

- Complexity invites bugs
- Use clearly named functions and variables
- Write code comments
- Break up long section of code into small functions
- Don't repeat yourself
- Legacy code is a security concern
- Built-in functions are often better than your own version
- Disable or remove unused feature when possible

### Never trust users

- Well-meaning users can cause problems
- Be paranoid: You have to adopt the mindset that everyone is out to get you. 
- Don't even trust admin users completely
    - Can become unhappy employees or ex-employees
    - May not take security seriously
    - Can have identity stolen
- Use caution with contractors
    - Both insider and outsider status
    - Often not fully vetted
    - Often transient
    - Make it easy to revoke their access
- Even offline
    - Phone: the famous hacker Kevin Mitnick recounts that much of his computer hacking was done by calling up people on the telephone and convincing them that he was trustworthy
    - Email
    - Printing

### Expect the unexpected
- Security is not reactive: your job is to figure out how that will happen ahead of time
- Prevent the crime before it happens
- "What are all the things a user could try on this page?
- Consider "edge cases"
- Get creative
- Example: Global search box
    - Length: too little or too much
    - Content-type: high-ASCII, multi-byte
    - Content: \"'(){}@#%@^%^#^&
    - Formats: safe for use in all formats
    - Structure and inputs: can they be modifed

### Defense in depth
- is like having an extra (backup) parachute for yourself.
- Layered defenses
- Redundant security
- Dimensions
    - People 
    - Technology
    - Operations

### Security through obscurity

### Blacklisting and whitelisting

### Map exposure points and data passageways

## 3. Filtering Input, Controlling Output

### Regulating requests

### Validating input

### Sanitizing data

### Labeling variables

### Keeping code private

### Keeping credentials private

### Keeping error messages vague

### Smart logging

## 4. The Most Common Attacks

### Cross-site scripting (XSS)

### Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

### SQL injection

### URL manipulation

### Faked requests and forms

### Cookie visibility and theft

### Session hijacking

### Session fixation

### Remote system execution

### File-upload abuse

### Denial of service

## 5. Encryption and User Authentication

### Password encryption

### Salting passwords

### Password requirements

### Brute-force attacks

### Using SSL for login

### Protecting cookies

### Regulating access privileges

### Handling forgotten passwords

### Multi-factor authentication

## 6. Other Areas of Concern

### Credit card payments

### Regular expression flaws

### Conversions and transformations

### Buffer overflows

### Source code managers

### Database security

### Server security
